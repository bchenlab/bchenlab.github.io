While every cell within the body shares identical genetic information, the epigenome (various biochemical modifications on DNA or histones) is dynamically modulated by diverse environmental signals to regulate gene expression in different cell types and during development. Trillions of bacteria live inside the gastrointestinal tract are collectively referred to as the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota is necessary to maintain host health by digesting complex carbohydrates, providing non-nutrient essential factors, and preventing pathogenic microbes from colonizing. Many bacteria-derived metabolites have been shown to alter the metabolic and inflammatory pathways in the host. Over the last few decades, lifestyle changes (sanitation, antibiotics usage, the consumption of high-fat and high-fructose diets, etc.) have been speculated to contribute to the onset of several immune, neurological, and metabolism-related diseases. More recently, imbalances in the gut microbiota are associated with type 1 and 2 diabetes, obesity, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, atherosclerosis, and other ailments. Although correlations have been observed between the development of different chronic diseases and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, the molecular mechanism underlying microbiota-mediated alternations in gene regulation is still largely uncharacterized. This research group aims to understand how the environmental conditions modulate host epigenome through gut microbiota and discover novel therapeutic targets for human diseases.
