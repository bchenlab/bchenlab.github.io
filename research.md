We develop and utilize high-throughput functional assays to understand how gene regulatory programme is controlled under different conditions. We are currently focusing on the following questions:

1. How does the human genome respond to environmental stimuli?
2. How does the dysbiosis in the gut microbiome lead to the development of liver diseases?
3. How does the gut microbiota affect colorectal cancer development?
